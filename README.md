# Data-With-Danny-SQL-Challenge
This is a case study from the 8 Week SQL Challenge by Data with Danny.

This first case study is on Danny's Diner which can be found below.

## Problem Statement

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

Danny has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!


## Case Study Questions

-- 1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
```sql  
SELECT s.customer_id, SUM(m.price) as total_spend
FROM sales as s
INNER JOIN menu as m 
ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id;
```


-- 2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
```sql 
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT order_date) as days_visited
FROM sales
Group by customer_id;
```


-- 3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
```sql  
WITH table_1 AS (
SELECT s.customer_id, m.product_name, s.order_date,
RANK()  OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.order_date) as rnk
FROM sales as s 
INNER JOIN menu as m
ON s.product_id = m.product_id)

SELECT customer_id, product_name
FROM final_table
Where rnk = 1;
```
-- 4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
```sql
SELECT m.product_name, 
COUNT(order_date) as orders
FROM sales as s
INNER JOIN menu as m 
ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY m.product_name
ORDER BY orders DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
-- 5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?
```sql
SELECT customer_id,product_name
FROM (
SELECT s.customer_id, m.product_name,
Rank() OVER(partition by s.customer_id ORDER BY COUNT(s.order_date) DESC) as rnk
FROM sales as s
INNER JOIN menu as m 
ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id, m.product_name) x
WHERE rnk = 1
GROUP BY customer_id,product_name;
```

-- 6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
```sql
WITH TABLE_2 AS (
SELECT mem.customer_id, m.product_name, s.order_date, mem.join_date,
RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY mem.customer_id  ORDER BY mem.join_date,s.order_date) as rnk
FROM sales as s
INNER JOIN menu as m 
ON s.product_id = m.product_id
INNER JOIN members as mem
ON s.customer_id = mem.customer_id
WHERE s.order_date <= mem.join_date)

SELECT customer_id, product_name
FROM TABLE_2
WHERE rnk = 1;
```
-- 7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
```sql
WITH TABLE_3 AS (
SELECT mem.customer_id, m.product_name, s.order_date, mem.join_date,
RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY mem.customer_id  ORDER BY mem.join_date,s.order_date DESC) as rnk
FROM sales as s
INNER JOIN menu as m 
ON s.product_id = m.product_id
INNER JOIN members as mem
ON s.customer_id = mem.customer_id
WHERE s.order_date < mem.join_date)

SELECT customer_id, product_name
FROM TABLE_3 
WHERE rnk = 1;
```

-- 8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
```sql
SELECT mem.customer_id, COUNT(m.product_name) as total_items, SUM(m.price) as Total_Spent
FROM sales as s
INNER JOIN menu as m 
ON s.product_id = m.product_id
INNER JOIN members as mem
ON s.customer_id = mem.customer_id
WHERE s.order_date < mem.join_date
GROUP BY mem.customer_id
ORDER BY mem.customer_id;
```

-- 9.  If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
```sql
SELECT s.customer_id,
SUM(CASE WHEN m.product_name = 'Sushi' THEN Price * 10 * 2
WHEN m.product_name = 'Curry' THEN Price * 10
WHEN m.product_name = 'Ramen' THEN Price * 10 ELSE 0 END) AS Points
FROM sales as s
INNER JOIN menu as m 
ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id;
```


-- 10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?
```sql
SELECT s.customer_id,
SUM(CASE 
WHEN s.order_date BETWEEN mem.join_date AND mem.join_date + INTERVAL  6 DAY THEN Price * 10 * 2
WHEN m.product_name = 'Sushi' THEN Price * 10 * 2
WHEN m.product_name = 'Curry' THEN Price * 10
WHEN m.product_name = 'Ramen' THEN Price * 10 ELSE 0 END) AS Points
FROM sales as s
INNER JOIN menu as m 
ON s.product_id = m.product_id
INNER JOIN members as mem
ON s.customer_id = mem.customer_id
WHERE EXTRACT(Month FROM s.order_date) = 1
GROUP BY s.customer_id
ORDER BY s.customer_id;
```
